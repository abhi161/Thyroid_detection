## Thyroid Detection

### Introduction
Thyroid Detection is a classification model designed to predict the type of thyroid based on provided values. This project encompasses an end-to-end pipeline, starting from acquiring data from clients, storing it in a database, to predicting the values using machine learning models.

### Purpose
The primary objective of Thyroid Detection is to assist hospitals in streamlining their workflow. By accurately predicting whether a person has thyroid and identifying the type of thyroid disorder, the model aids in efficient patient management. Depending on the diagnosis, reports can be directed to senior doctors for immediate attention in case of hyperthyroidism, while reports indicating hypothyroidism or negative results can be handled by junior doctors.

### Features
- **Data Acquisition**: Data is obtained from clients and undergoes validation before being stored in the database.
- **Training Pipeline**: The data is extracted from the database and fed into a training pipeline. This involves dividing the data into clusters and creating separate machine learning models for each cluster.
- **Prediction Route**: Prediction is done separately for each cluster, utilizing the trained models. This ensures accurate predictions based on the assigned clusters.

### Usage
1. **Data Collection**: Acquire data from clients.
2. **Data Validation**: Validate the acquired data.
3. **Database Storage**: Store the validated data in the database.
4. **Training**: Extract data from the database and feed it into the training pipeline.
5. **Model Building**: Create separate models for individual clusters.
6. **Prediction**: Utilize the prediction route to predict thyroid types based on the provided values.
7. **Workflow Optimization**: Direct reports to appropriate medical staff based on the predicted diagnosis.

### Benefits
- Improves workflow efficiency in hospitals.
- Enables accurate prediction of thyroid disorders.
- Facilitates timely medical attention for patients requiring immediate assistance.

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with hospital management systems for seamless workflow integration.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of models for improved accuracy.
- Expansion to include prediction of additional medical conditions for comprehensive patient assessment.

### Conclusion
Thyroid Detection is a powerful tool designed to enhance the efficiency of hospital operations and improve patient care through accurate prediction of thyroid disorders. By leveraging machine learning techniques and a robust end-to-end pipeline, this project aims to revolutionize healthcare management in thyroid-related cases.
